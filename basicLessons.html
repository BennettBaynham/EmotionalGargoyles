            <h3 style="text-align:center;" id="addition">Addition</h3>

            <p>Start by aligning the small plates. You can line them up in a row from left to right. Make an addition 
                sign with the black tape between the first plate (leftmost) and the second plate (center). Make an equal 
                sign with the black tape between the second plate and the final plate (rightmost).</p>
            
            <p>Let's start by adding small numbers. Place 3 kernels on the first plate and 5 kernels on the second plate. 
                What is being represented here is 3 + 5. Move all the kernels to the rightmost dish and count them up. There 
                should be 8 because 3 + 5 = 8. You can write this on your paper. Explore some other small number addition and 
                write the results on your paper. When you are ready, you can move on to larger numbers.</p>
            
            <p>To begin to add larger numbers, start by making groups of 10 kernels. Line them up on the sticky side of 
                a piece of tape and tape over them so that you have clusters of 10 kernels.</p>
            
            <p>Now try adding 43 and 28. On your paper write out the stacked method of adding 43 and 28. Remember that each 
                packet of kernels is 10 kernels. Count by 10s to get to 40 and then add 3. There should be 4 packets and 3 
                loose kernels in your leftmost dish. Following this method, there should be 2 packets and 8 loose kernels in your 
                center plate. If you are unsure of this, count each kernel individually; you should be able to see them through the tape!.</p>

            <p>Now add the two plates together. Start by counting the loose kernels. This is like adding the ones column in addition. 
                If you have 10 kernels make a new kernel 10 pack. Now add up all the remaining loose kernels (there should be 1) This 
                is the value you place in the ones place on your paper. Next count up the packets. There should be 4 from the first 
                plate, 2 from the 2nd plate and 1 that you just made when adding the singles together. There should be 7 in all. 
                This is the value to write in your 10s place on your paper.</p>

            <p>43 + 28 = 71</p>
            <p>Repeat this with other numbers until you feel comfortable.</p>

            <p>Start by aligning the small plates. You can line them up in a row from left to right. Make an subtraction 
                sign with the black tape between the first plate (leftmost) and the second plate (center). Make an equal 
                sign with the black tape between the second plate and the final plate (rightmost).</p>
            
            <p>Let's start by subtracting small numbers. Place 5 kernels on the first plate and 3 kernels on the second plate. 
                What is being represented here is 5 - 3. Move all the kernels on the leftmost dish to the rightmost dish and count the kernals on the middle dish. There 
                should be 3. Now take 3 kernals out of the right most dish. There should be 2 on the right most dish because 5 - 3 = 2. You can write this on your paper. Explore some other small number subtraction and 
                write the results on your paper. When you are ready, you can move on to larger numbers.</p>
            
            <p>To begin to subtract larger numbers, start by making groups of 10 kernels. Line them up on the sticky side of 
                a piece of tape and tape over them so that you have clusters of 10 kernels.</p>

                loose kernels in your leftmost dish. Following this method, there should be 2 packets and 8 loose kernels in your

                This is the value to write in your 10s place on your paper.</p>

            <p>43 - 28 = 15</p>

            <p>Repeat this with other numbers until you feel comfortable.</p>

            <h3 style="text-align:center;" id="places">Places</h3>
            <p>Every number that you know is made by placing different numbers into different PLACES.</p>

            <p>These numbers can be in the ONES place, the TENS place, or the HUNDREDS place. The first small numbers with only one DIGIT (each number in each place) only have a number in the ones place.</p>

            <p>For example: 7 has a seven in the ones place</p>

            <p>Larger numbers have digits in the tens place and the ones place.  These are called TWO-DIGIT NUMBERS.</p>

            <p>For example: 14 is a two-digit number with a 1 in the tens place and a 4 in the ones place.</p>

            <p>Finally even larger numbers can become THREE-DIGIT NUMBERS, with a number in the tens place, a number in the ones place, and a third number in the hundreds place.</p>

            <p>For example: 130 is a three-digit number with a 1 in the hundreds place, a 3 in the tens place, and a 0 in the ones place.</p>

            <h3 style="text-align:center;" id="multiplication">Multiplication</h3>
            <p>Multiplication, one of the four basic operations of arithmetic, gives the result of combining groups 
                of equal sizes.</p>
            
            <p>Here each group has 3 ice creams, and there are two such groups. So, there are 2 times 3 or 3 + 3 or 
                6 ice creams in total. In other words, multiplication is repeated addition. </p>
            
            <p>Multiplication is represented by the signs cross âÃâ, asterisk â*â or dot âÂ·â. When we multiply two 
                numbers, the answer we get is called âproductâ. The number of objects in each group is called 
                âmultiplicand,â and the number of such equal groups is called âmultiplierâ.</p>
            
            <p>Example:</p>
            <p>3 Ã 7 = 7 + 7 + 7 = 21</p>
            <p>5 Ã 6 = 6 + 6 + 6 + 6 + 6 = 30</p>
            <p>In the given image, 4 flowers have 8 petals each. To find the total number of petals, we can multiply 
                the number of flowers by the number of petals in each flower. Thus, the multiplicand is 8, the multiplier 
                is 4, and the product is 4 Ã 8 or 32. That is, there are 32 petals in all.</p>

            <h3 style="text-align:center;" id="division">Division</h3>
            <p>The division is a method of distributing a group of things into equal parts. It is one of the four 
                basic operations of arithmetic, which gives a fair result of sharing. </p>
            
            <p>The division is an operation inverse of multiplication. If 3 groups of 4 make 12 in multiplication; 12 
                divided into 3 equal groups give 4 in each group in division.</p>
            
            <p>The main goal of the division is to see how many equal groups or how many in each group when sharing fairly.</p>
            
            <p>For example:</p>

            <p>There are 16 balls and 4 boxes, how to put 16 balls into four equal sized boxes?</p>
            <p>So, 16 divided by 4 =?</p>
            <p>Therefore, 4 balls should be kept in each box. </p>
            <p>There are various signs which can be used to indicate division such as Ã·, /. </p>
            <p>For example:</p>
            <p>- 8 Ã· 2</p>
            <p>- 8/2</p>
            <p>Each part involved in a division equation has a special name. </p>
            <p>Dividend Ã· Divisor = Quotient</p>
