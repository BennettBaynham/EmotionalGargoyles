The Plan for this I guess??


So I had the idea that this could be some sort of pirate game, where the number tells you where the x is, and you have to walk the pirate over to find it. Using the arrow keys wouldn't be to hard as controls or we could use the mouse. Maybe the mouse is better. Anyways we scroll to the right spot where the treasure is hidden then there's like 3 frames of digging then treasure. Then you can just do it again??? The X is at a random number between 1 and 20, and 1 and 100 for more advanced kids??
